# Mini App Example Project

## Getting Started

The Mini App Example project is a sample project built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to create a web interface.

### Prerequisites

Before running the Mini App Example, make sure you have the following software installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### About Project Structure

This project is divided into two main parts: Frontend and Backend.

1. The Frontend is located in the `src/app` folder (excluding `src/app/api`).
2. The Backend is located in the `src/app/api` folder, which includes examples of API usage.

### Starting to Develop

To begin developing your Mini App, go to the `src/app` folder and start modifying the files within it. We suggest starting with the `src/app/page.tsx` file, as it serves as the main page for your Mini App. This file includes examples of basic functions such as authentication and payment, allowing you to kickstart your development right away.

### Integrate with OAPI Services using Provided Functions

In this project, we have prepared functions for working with OAPI Services. These functions are located in the `src/lib/frontend/index.ts` file and we create a example usage in `src/app/page.tsx` file.

#### Authentication service

##### Prerequisites for using the authentication service

Setup the environment variables in the `.env` file:

```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_THREE_LEGGED_CLIENT_ID=<3-legged-client-id>   # 3 legged client id value from OAPI Portal. Use for initAuth via jsbridge. it must be the same as the `THREE_LEGGED_CLIENT_ID` in backend config
   NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHENTICATION_SCOPE=openid+offline           # authentication scope value from OAPI Portal. Use for initAuth via jsbridge. it must be the same as the `AUTHENTICATION_SCOPE` in backend config

   THREE_LEGGED_CLIENT_ID=<3-legged-client-id>               # 3 legged client id value from OAPI Portal
   THREE_LEGGED_SECRET_KEY=<3-legged-client-secret>          # 3 legged secret key value from OAPI Portal
   ENDPOINT_EXCHANGE_TOKEN=https://oapi.service/exchange          # OAPI Service endpoint for exchange token
   ENDPOINT_GET_CUSTOMER_PROFILE=https://oapi.service/customer    # OAPI Service endpoint for get customer profile
   AUTHENTICATION_SCOPE=openid+offline                       # authentication scope from OAPI Portal sparated by '+', example: openid+offline
   AUTHENTICATION_REDIRECT_URL=https://your.miniapp          # redirect url. it must be the same as the authentication redirect url in OAPI Portal and default destination url in miniapp Portal
```

1. `initAuth` - Calls jsbridge `initAuth` with clientId and scope values from environment variables, and sends an API request to OAPI Services to exchange the token.
2. `getCustomerProfile` - Retrieves the customer profile using the access token obtained from the token exchange with PT Pass.

#### Payment service

##### Prerequisites for using the payment service

Setup the environment variables in the `.env` file:

```bash
   TWO_LEGGED_CLIENT_ID=<2-legged-client-id>                          # 2 legged client id value from OAPI Portal
   TWO_LEGGED_SECRET_KEY=<2-legged-client-secret>                     # 2 legged secret key value from OAPI Portal
   ENDPOINT_PAYMENT_GET_TOKEN=https://oapi.service/oauth/token             # OAPI Service endpoint for get 2 legged token        
   ENDPOINT_PAYMENT_DEEPLINK=https://oapi.service/deeplink                 # OAPI Service endpoint for get payment deeplink
   ENDPOINT_PAYMENT_INQUIRY_TRANSACTION_URL=https://oapi.service/inquiry   # OAPI Service endpoint for inquiry transaction
   PAYMENT_TXN_CONFIG_COMP_CODE=00000                                 # company code value from OAPI Portal in merchant configuration
   PAYMENT_TXN_CONFIG_DEEPLINK_URL=https://your.miniapp/result        # deeplink url for return to app after payment completed
```

##### Payment service functions

1. `initPayment` - Get access token and initialize payment transaction and opens the payment flow for completing the transaction.
2. `inquiryPaymentTransaction` - Get access token and inquiry the transaction status using the txnRefId

These functions will invoke the APIs within this project, located in the `src/app/api` folder. Examples of API usage are provided and can be modified as needed. Additionally, we provide backend functions for integrating with OAPI services in the `src/lib/backend` folder, You can use these functions with your own services.
